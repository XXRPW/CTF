Training: PHP LFI

This is a simple LFI vulnerability challenge

challenge:
Your mission is to exploit this code, which has obviously an LFI vulnerability:

GeSHi`ed PHP code
1
2
$filename = 'pages/'.(isset($_GET["file"])?$_GET["file"]:"welcome").'.html';
include $filename;


There is a lot of important stuff in ../solution.php, so please include and execute this file for us.

Here are a few examples of the script in action (in the box below):
index.php?file=welcome
index.php?file=news
index.php?file=forums

For debugging purposes, you may look at the whole source again, also as highlighted version.

if you look at this code

$filename = 'pages/'.(isset($_GET["file"])?$_GET["file"]:"welcome").'.html';
include $filename;

it includes the file value pafter pages/ and adds .html at the end

if you click at the /solution.php which we need to run and look at the link
https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/php/lfi/solution.php

which is two more directories upper then pages

so if we use ../../ it will solve the challenge
but it adds the .html at the end and we can solve that by putting %00 which is null and ignoring the .html
so it will be like..

https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/php/lfi/up/index.php?file=../../solution.php%00

then this solves the challenge
