<h1>Training:Crypto-Ceasar I</h1>

This is a Ceasar training and what is a Ceasar?
Ceasar is which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphbet. For example if it's right 2 shift
A will be C and D will be F

So the text for this example is 

ZNK WAOIQ HXUCT LUD PASVY UBKX ZNK RGFE JUM UL IGKYGX GTJ EUAX ATOWAK YURAZOUT OY YNIIGJSKGKJJ

and if you go to this website
https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher
and increasing the shift from 0 and at 20 there will be a normal text which is 

THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG OF CAESAR AND YOUR UNIQUE SOLUTION IS SHCCADMEAEDD

and there you go that is your solution
