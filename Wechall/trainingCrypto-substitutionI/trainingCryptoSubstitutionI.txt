I found a really nice website for crypto for this challenge so it was really easy for me to solve it which is 

https://quipqiup.com/

challenge:
Oh dear, I guess you have cracked the two caesar cryptos...
This one is more difficult. Although a simple substitution is easily cracked...
Again the characters are limited to A-Z... But I think I can come up with a 256 version again.

Enjoy!
