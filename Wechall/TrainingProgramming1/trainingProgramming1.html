This is just a simple programming challenge

I used python 2.7.13 for this

the code is 
<pre>
import requests
cookie = {'WC': ''}
r = requests.post('https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/programming1/index.php?action=request', cookies=cookie)
shell = r.text
r = requests.post('https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/programming1/index.php?answer='+shell,cookies=cookie)
</pre>

This requests to the link and reads the code and requests it to the other link with the read code in it

then this solves the challenge
*in the cookie, you need to put your own cookie session.
