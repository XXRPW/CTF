not sure why this challenge is under the trainingLFI challenge

anyways the challenge is

I have written another include system for my dynamic webpages, but it seems to be vulnerable to LFI.
Here is the code:

<?php
if (isset($_GET['which']))
{
        $which = $_GET['which'];
        switch ($which)
        {
        case 0:
        case 1:
        case 2:
                require_once $which.'.php';
                break;
        default:
                echo GWF_HTML::error('PHP-0817', 'Hacker NoNoNo!', false);
                break;
        }
}
?>

Your mission is to include solution.php.
Here is the script in action: News, Forum, Guestbook.

Good Luck!

this is a really simple LFI challenge 
which will be
index.php?which=solution

and this will run solution.php which will solve the challenge

easy enough??
